# Summary


This Malware Triage section is focused solely on quick triage to determine if a sample is indeed "malicious" and likely malware. It doesn’t cover in-depth analysis, such as reverse engineering or examining specific functions like UAC bypass or log deletion. For a detailed breakdown of all capabilities in a sample, it’s best to consult professionals who specialize in malware analysis.
