# YARA

YARA is a tool that helps identify and classify malware by using rules to find specific patterns in files, like strings or code fragments. It's useful in malware analysis because you can create custom rules to detect known malware or find related files that share similar traits.

You can use **LOKI** to quickly run a set of YARA rules across multiple binaries to check for signs of malware or suspicious behavior. LOKI is a scanner that comes with a collection of pre-built YARA rules and can also run custom rules you provide. This makes it a powerful tool for performing quick triage and detecting potential threats in binaries by matching them against known malware patterns.
