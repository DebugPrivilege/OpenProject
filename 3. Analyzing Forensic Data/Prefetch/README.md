# Prefetch

Prefetch is a Windows feature that optimizes the performance of frequently accessed applications by preloading portions of their files into memory. It stores information about the last 8 executions of an executable, including timestamps and file paths. These Prefetch files (.pf) are located in the **C:\Windows\Prefetch** directory and are created when a program is run.
