# Summary


This Malware Triage section is focused solely on quick triage to determine if a sample is indeed "malicious" and likely malware. It doesn’t cover in-depth analysis, such as reverse engineering or examining specific functions like UAC bypass or log deletion. For a detailed breakdown of all capabilities in a sample, it’s best to consult professionals who specialize in malware analysis.

## How to start?

1. First, we need to install **Windows Sandbox** on our machine, as it will be used for dynamic analysis. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview

2. Next, we need to configure AV exclusions on our Forensics VM by excluding the **Downloads** folder and the **C:\Temp** folder.

To exclude the **Downloads** folder from Windows Defender AV:

```
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads"
```

To exclude the **C:\Temp** folder from Windows Defender AV:

```
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Temp"
```
