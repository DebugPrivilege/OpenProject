## Windows Defender AV


Windows Defender AV can be useful for leveraging its intelligence to detect potentially malicious files, especially in cases where YARA rules may have missed them.

## How to start?

1. First, gather all the malware samples you’ve received and place them in a single folder. For this example, we’ll store the samples in the C:\Temp folder, which we have also excluded from Windows Defender AV.

2. Now, let's place a malware sample in the Desktop folder, which hasn’t been excluded from Windows Defender AV, so it should trigger an alert.

In this example, Windows Defender AV identified the binary as Cobalt Strike.
