# Master File Table (MFT)

The Master File Table (MFT) is a core component of the NTFS file system, which keeps track of all files and directories on a drive, including metadata such as file names, timestamps, and file sizes. In DFIR, analyzing the MFT helps investigators trace file activity and determine when files were created, modified, or accessed. This can provide valuable evidence during an investigation.
