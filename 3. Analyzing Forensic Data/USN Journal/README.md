# USN Journal


The USN (Update Sequence Number) Journal is an NTFS feature that logs file and directory changes on a volume, such as creations, deletions, modifications, and renames. Stored in a hidden file called **$UsnJrnl** within the **$Extend** directory, it tracks changes as they occur.

## How to start?

1. Use MFTECmd.exe to parse the $UsnJrnl file into a CSV format, which can then be loaded into tools like Timeline Explorer. To do this, run the following command:

```
MFTECmd.exe -f "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\DC\C\$MFT" --csv C:\Temp
```

2. Now, you can use Eric Zimmermanâ€™s Timeline Explorer to load the .CSV output and analyze the raw data.

3. You can also load the .CSV file into Azure Data Explorer (ADX), where Microsoft provides a free 100 GB cluster. This lets you run Kusto queries to analyze the data.
