# EVTX


EVTX files are Windows event log files that store records of system, application, and security events on the computer. They’re used by the Windows Event Viewer to display details about things like hardware changes, software activity, and login attempts. EVTX files are saved in **C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs** by default, and they’re useful for tracking what’s happening on a system whether for troubleshooting issues or investigating security events.
