# Malware Protection Logs

MpLogs are diagnostic logs generated by Microsoft Defender Antivirus that record detailed information about Defenderâ€™s security actions, such as malware detections, scans, and command-line operations flagged as suspicious. Stored in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Support`, these logs contain data like file paths, timestamps, threat names, and process metrics. During DFIR, MpLogs are valuable for tracing malware activity and identifying the files or processes that triggered alerts, such as malicious PowerShell commands or attempts to disable Defender for example. 

I created this script for Live Response scenarios with Defender for Endpoint. When an alert is triggered on an endpoint, it helps me quickly gather diagnostic logs generated by Windows Defender Antivirus to give me a broader insight to check if there were additional detections or suspicious activity.
