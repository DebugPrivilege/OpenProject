# Windows Error Reporting (WER)

Windows Error Reporting (WER) logs application crashes and system errors in `.wer` files, capturing information like crash timestamps, application paths, and a **SHA1** hash that uniquely identifies the crashed application. In DFIR, this **SHA1** hash can be useful because it helps analysts quickly identify specific applications or potentially malicious files.
