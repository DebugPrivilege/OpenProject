# Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis is a way to study malware by actually running it in a secure, controlled setup like a virtual machine or sandbox. This lets analysts watch what the malware does in real time, such as the files it creates, changes it makes to the system, and any network connections it tries to establish. By observing its behavior directly, dynamic analysis helps reveal what the malware is capable of.

## How to start?

1. Open **Windows Sandbox**
2. Download **SystemInformer** on your Windows Sandbox. https://sourceforge.net/projects/systeminformer/
3. Copy the Malware safely to your **Windows Sandbox**

4. We can use SystemInformer to identify the network connections the malware is trying to establish, which can help reveal its command-and-control (C2) server.
