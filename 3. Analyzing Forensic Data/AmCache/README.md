# AmCache

AmCache is a Windows registry hive file that records detailed metadata about executables, drivers, and installed applications on a system. It includes information like SHA1 hashes, file paths, installation dates, and publisher details. While it cannot confirm program execution (because of automated OS scans that log files for compatibility checks), it provides evidence of file presence. AmCache is useful in DFIR for timeline creation, threat hunting, and correlating hashes with known malicious files.
