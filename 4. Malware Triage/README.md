# Summary


This Malware Triage section is focused solely on quick triage to determine if a sample is indeed "malicious" and likely malware. It doesn’t cover in-depth analysis, such as reverse engineering or examining specific functions like UAC bypass or log deletion. For a detailed breakdown of all capabilities in a sample, it’s best to consult professionals who specialize in malware analysis.

## How to start?

1. First, we need to install **Windows Sandbox** on our machine, as it will be used for dynamic analysis. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview

2. Next, we need to configure AV exclusions on our Forensics VM by excluding the **Downloads** folder and the **C:\Temp** folder.

To exclude the **Downloads** folder from Windows Defender AV:

```
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads"
```

To exclude the **C:\Temp** folder from Windows Defender AV:

```
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Temp"
```

## How can a customer share Malware safely?

The customer should compress the malware sample into a .7z file using 7zip and set the password to infected (without quotes). After that, they can share the file via a shared OneDrive, for example.

## What is the first thing you should do when receiving a malware sample?

Start by running **Sigcheck.exe** from SysInternals to obtain the **SHA256** hash of the sample. Then, copy this hash and check it on **VirusTotal** for any existing detections. Consider these questions: Is the binary unsigned? Does it include any description or company information in the PE header?

VirusTotal identified the file as malicious. It's also a good idea to check the "Community" tab for comments from other users, which may provide helpful insights into the nature of the malware sample.
