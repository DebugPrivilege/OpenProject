# CyLR

CyLR is a forensic tool built to quickly and securely gather key artifacts from NTFS systems with minimal impact. It collects important data without relying on the Windows API, which makes the process fast and discreet. You can customize whatâ€™s collected, even targeting specific types of files like those in use, hidden, or system files, including alternate data streams. The collected data is stored in a ZIP file, with options to adjust compression, set a password, and send it to an SFTP location if needed.
