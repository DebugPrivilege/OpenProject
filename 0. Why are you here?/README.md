# Common mistake

Imagine you’re a small or medium business with a limited budget for full-time staff. Then, on a Monday morning, you get an alert from your EDR solution about suspicious activity on your Exchange server. It looks like the attacker is actively moving within your environment, and the natural reaction is to quickly shut down the server to contain the attack. But this is where things can go wrong, shutting down the server at this point would mean losing valuable forensic data and possibly other critical information needed to understand the full extent of the attack.

## Why do we need to collect forensic data?

We need to collect forensic data before starting recovery because it captures important details about the attack and how it started, which systems were affected, and whether any data was taken. If we skip this step, we might lose evidence that shows the full picture, leaving us open to further attacks or missing the root cause. It also helps meet legal requirements and ensures we’re not just putting a temporary fix in place.
